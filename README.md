# My Portfolio

## Overview

A modern, visually striking personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, publications, teaching experience, and skills. Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite** (or Next.js) to provide a fast, responsive, and interactive experience. The design emphasizes premium aesthetics with dark mode, glassmorphism, smooth micro‑animations, and a cohesive color palette.

## Features

- **Dynamic hero section** with a looping background video.
- **Interactive cards** for portfolio items, tutorials, publications, and teaching sections with hover effects and smooth transitions.
- **Real‑time header** displaying current time and location.
- **Responsive layout** that works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **SEO‑friendly** markup with proper meta tags, heading hierarchy, and semantic HTML.
- **Dark mode** with elegant glass‑morphism styling.
- **Fast loading** using optimized WebP images and lazy loading.

## Tech Stack

- **React** with **TypeScript** (`.tsx` components)
- **Vite** (development server & bundler) – run with `npm run dev`
- **CSS** (vanilla) with custom design tokens
- **Google Fonts** – Inter, Roboto, Outfit
- **GitHub Pages** (or any static host) for deployment
